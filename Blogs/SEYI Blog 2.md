# The Middle

In a blink of an eye, this internship is slowly coming to an end. The camping trip to Pinnacles National Park was marvelous as I got to bond with other interns in the biodiversity group.  Approximately two weeks ago, I was assigned to research the tiering levels of marine animals and its relationship with body size evolution. Along with the research came with many productive struggles like coding in R. 

The overnight trip to Pinnacles was similar yet very different from my previous camping trips. 
The most remarkable part about the trip was definitely the hikes and bonding with everyone under the Milky Way galaxy. The hike up the Geology Trail and reservoir took my breath away both physically and emotionally. Knowing it’ll be worth the heavy breathing, I continued. The amazing view at the top and millions of swirling trees blended into the mountains was entirely worth dying for. As dusk was approaching, stars danced before my very eyes, jokes and laughter filled the air while stress from the city fades away. Amongst a bed of stars that twinkle in the sky, stars fell from way up high. These things became cherished memories as I fall asleep in the starry night. 

After the camping trip, we began working on our research. The program, R was still fairly new to me. Realizing the exercises I’ve done previously was not enough for me to learn how to graph in R, I took a step back and focused on the basics of R. In the end, I was able to produce 7 graphs, of course with help from Noel and Chris. 

Next week, I will begin a new challenge: writing a part of the research paper. I am excited yet anxious! With only three more weeks left of the program, I will continue to try my best and make the most of it!
