#The End

Today, August 9th marks the final day of 2018 Stanford Earth Young Investigators internship. This summer was truly remarkable and memorable. I have encountered many firsts, from writing blogs, to coding, to writing a research paper, and much more. Although coding in R was difficult, it was an experience that I’ll probably never get to try if it wasn’t for this program. Writing the research paper was also quite an experience! From the drafts, I could see the improvements in my writing as well as my analytical skills. Although this program had officially ended, we, the biodiversity interns will continue to improve our sections of the paper over the next couple of months! 

Something that is also worth mentioning is that we’ve finished the book, Why Size Matters written by John Tyler Bonner on Tuesday! This was a book that we read throughout our time here. It helped me understand the reason behind our research on body sizes and gave me a whole new perspective on the different body sizes that exist. Our writing was also inspired by this book! 

As I am writing this blog, a series of flashbacks are running through my head. This internship was too short, it seems as if it was just yesterday, I was sitting with my father in the meeting room in the Mitchell Building attending the orientation and meeting Jenny and Noel for the first time. In the eight weeks at Stanford, not only did I learn about my research topic, I also learned technical skills! I got a chance to become a researcher myself and learn more about earth science.

Here, I would like to thank those who made this internship amazing. 
Jenny - Thank you for giving me this opportunity to be a part of this program and organizing speakers and field trips to make sure we get the full aspect of the Earth science field!
Noel - Thank you so much for all your support and guidance! Thank you for your patience and positive attitude when teaching me how to code. You are truly the BEST mentor I’ve ever had. 
Interns - Thank you for making this internship fun and memorable! 

Goodbye SEYI 2018! You will be missed!
